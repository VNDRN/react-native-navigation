### How do I make an Animated splash screen?

The best way to make an animated splash screen is to mount a React Native component which is identical to your splash screen. Firstly, we register a page called "LaunchPage" and `setRoot` with that component when the application starts:

```js
Navigation.registerComponent('LaunchPage', () => LaunchPage);

Navigation.setRoot({
  root: {
    stack: {
      children: [
        {
          component: {
            name: 'LaunchPage',
            options: {
              topBar: {
                visible: false,
              },
            },
          },
        },
      ],
    },
  },
});
```

Now that we have a React component (which looks identical to the splash screen) appears after initializing, we can
perform any animation in that component. Below, for example, we have a video play after the splash screen. The first
still shot of the video, is the splash screen configured (like in the guides above):

```jsx
export const LaunchPage = () => {
  return (
    <View style={styles.containerStyle}>
      <Video
        posterResizeMode={'cover'}
        source={require('../assets/launch.mp4')}
        style={styles.imageStyle}
        resizeMode={'cover'}
        onEnd={onVideoEnd}
      />
    </View>
  );

  function onVideoEnd() {
    Navigation.setRoot({
      root: {
        stack: {
          children: [
            {
              component: {
                name: 'MainPage',
              },
            },
          ],
        },
      },
    });
  }
};
```

Once the video/animation is done, we `setRoot` to the main entry point of your application (in our case "MainPage"). This example covers
a video, but you could build out your parts of your splash screen with `<View/>`, `<Image />` and `<Text />` component, animate them separately,
then transition to your application.

### My splash screen has a white flash?

Your splash screen may have a white flash, this is caused due to the app being finished initializing before React Native is done initializing.
To get rid of the white flash between your splash screen and React Native initializing, set the `waitForRender` flag to `true` on your `setRoot` animation:

```
Navigation.setDefaultOptions({
    animations: {
        setRoot: {
            waitForRender: true
        }
    }
});
```
